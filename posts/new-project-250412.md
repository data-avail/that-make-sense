Idea: Get the relations (between people) and display them on the graph online.
Relations between people should be confirmed with links.
Each relation has 3 categories:
+ family realtion
    + parent
    + child
    + brother
    + husband
    + merriage
+ private relation
+ professional relation

Graph is undirected.

Stage 1 - roadmap:
+ display graph (3d.js)
+ upload relation data in bunch
+ import - export from gexf format.


## Display graph ##
